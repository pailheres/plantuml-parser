# UML Parser

This is a Proof-of-Concept UML parser. This is still WIP, and support is
being added incrementally. UML is being parsed using LARK and described in
EBNF.

## Usage

```
python uml-parser.py -i <uml-file>
```

## TODOs

* Finish Class Diagram
* Add support for other diagrams;

* Add setup.py
* Output AST as JSON or other usable format instead of STDOUT
